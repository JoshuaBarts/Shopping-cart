    <h5>1) WHAT WE COLLECT</h5>

    <p><b>“Personal Information”</b> is any information that relates to you and identifies you personally, either alone or in 
    combination with other information. JMB may collect various types of personal information and special categories of 
    personal information (including health and other sensitive data about you, as explained in greater detail below).</p>
    <p>We will ask for your consent if we wish to use your Personal Information for purposes other than those listed 
    in this privacy statement, or if we are required to do so under applicable law.</p>
    <p><b>i. Information we collect when you create an Account</b>
    <p>If you sign up for an JMB account, for example, through the global single sign on, which allows you to use the same sign-in details anywhere in the world, we will ask for your:</p>
    <p>•	name;</p>
    <p>•	e-mail address; and</p>
    <p>•	password.</p>
    <p>•	Address;</p>
    
    <p><b>ii. Information we collect Automatically on our Sites and Mobile Applications</b></p>
    <p>We will automatically collect Personal Information about you when you interact with our brands, websites, as follows:</p>
    <p><b>Websites:</b> we will collect information about the JMB websites that you visit and how you use them. 
    A visit to one of our websites results in data being sent from your browser to our servers. The information we 
    collect in this way includes:</p>
    <p>•	your IP address;</p>
    <p>•	the date and time of the visit and how long you remained on our website;</p>
    <p>•	the referral URL (the site from which you came to our website);</p>

    <p>•	information about the device and browser you used to visit our website (including, browser type and version, 
    operating system, etc.).</p>
    <p><b>Cookies and similar devices:</b> We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when 
    you visit our websites or use our Apps, and this will include sending one or more cookies or other similar devices 
    to your device. </p>
    <p><b>Location Information:</b> Information that may determine your location is called “Location Information” in this 
    statement. We offer location-enabled services within some of our (mobile) applications, such as Google 
    Maps and Bing Maps. If you use those applications, they may receive information about your actual location 
    (such as GPS signals sent by a mobile device) or information that can be used to approximate a location. You 
    are always asked if the Geolocation Service can be activated and you can choose not to activate it or to turn it off.</p>
    <p>We may use the Google Maps service or the Bing Maps service to assist you in finding an JMB store. To facilitate 
    this, we load an image from Google Maps or Bing Maps, saving the route data and map image on our server.</p>
    <p>•	For further Information on Google Maps and their privacy policy please read their 
    privacy policy:http://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/</p>
    <p>•	For further information on Bing Maps and their Privacy Policy please read their 
    privacy policy: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/product/terms</p>
    <p>With your consent, we may also use various technologies to determine your location, such as sensor data 
    from your device that may, for example, provide information on nearby Wi-Fi access points, Near Field 
    Communication ('NFC') points and mobile network cell towers. You can generally disable sending your location 
    through settings in your device, and we will inform you when we make use of location information.</p>
    <p><b>iii. Information we collect when you use our Products or Services</b></p>
    <p>When you use our products and services, we will ask for certain Personal Information. We will explain 
    what information is required and what information you may choose to provide. This information may include information such as:</p>
    <p><b>Using our Products and Services</b></p>
    <p>•	your postal address and payment details when ordering from our web shop;</p>
    <p>•	your email-address so we can provide you with your receipt and contact you with offers or promotions as permitted by 
    applicable law, or when you are signing up for one of our contests such as register as a new member.</p>
    <p><b>iv. How JMB Collects Personal Information</b></p>
    <p>Most of the Personal Information we collect about you will be information that you have voluntarily 
    provided to us, for example, through our websites, e-shops, or by making purchases in one of our stores, 
    as outlined above. You agree that other sources from whom we may obtain your Personal Information 
    include:</p> 
    <p>(i) other JMB’s website companies; and</p> 
    <p>(ii) third parties (such as credit reference agencies with your consent, law enforcement/regulatory bodies), 
    all as permitted by applicable privacy laws.</p>
    
    <h5>2) HOW WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
    
    <p>The Personal Information we collect when you create an account with us will be used for identification and 
    authentication purposes across JMB services, so you can use the same account details to log in from any 
    location and on any device. The global single sign on will allow JMB systems to identify you wherever you 
    are in the world, meaning you will not need to register with us again if you are signing in from a different 
    country. In addition, JMB will create a profile for you with the information needed to provide you with our 
    products or services. The Personal Information we collect as listed above will be used in the format that it 
    is received, or, where appropriate, will be combined with Personal Information we obtain from other internal 
    or external sources.</p>
    <p>We use and analyze this Personal Information for the various purposes described below:</p>
    <p><b>i. Improving our products and services:</b> we will use your Personal Information to build a profile on you in 
    order to understand how you use our products and services, to develop more interesting and relevant products

    you may see on third party sites. For information on how to opt-out of this personalization please see “Your 
    rights in relation to your Personal Information” below.</p>
    <p><b>ii. Processing your order:</b> we use relevant Personal Information described above (including your name, address, 
    email and payment details) to process and deliver your order, and to notify you of the status of your order. 
    In addition, we may use your age, year of birth or confirmation that you are above a certain age to ascertain 
    whether you meet the minimum age in your country for online purchases and whether you are considered to be a 
    minor for data protection and/or marketing law purposes.</p>
    <p><b>iii. Carrying out Checks:</b> we will also use your Personal Information to prevent fraud, and with your consent, 
    to assess your creditworthiness. For this purpose, we may need to share your Personal Information with our credit 
    rating providers (see 'how we share your Personal Information' below), with your consent as required by applicable law.</p>
    <p><b>iv. Customer Service:</b> if you contact our Customer Service (or vice versa), we will use Personal Information 
    such as your order information and contact history to process your request and provide you with our best service possible.</p>
    <p><b>v. JMB products and services, engagements and offerings:</b> we will use your Personal Information to provide 
    you with the products and services you have requested from us, such as promotions, membership in JMB Communities, 
    JMB loyalty programs, events and our Apps. This will, if applicable, include the use of your Personal Information 
    for submission in contests, Prize Giveaways and promotions, using your contact details when you sign up for events 
    and using information like your location for our mobile Apps, with your consent, and as explained in more detail 
    in our Apps (for example, running Apps that use your location to help you plot your route when you have signed up for an event).</p>
    <p><b>vi. Improving our Products and Services:</b> we will use the Personal Information we hold about you (as well as 
    pseudonymized or anonymized information generated from your Personal Information) to carry out analysis and research, including:
    data science/analytics, whereby we combine information (such as Personal Information and/or sensitive Personal Information 
    we have obtained through the use of an JMB gaming app or from your browsing history) we hold on a large scale in order:</p>
    <p>•	to learn more about our customers and their preferences;</p>
    <p>•	to identify patterns and trends amongst our customers;</p>
    <p>•	to enhance user experience on our websites;</p>
    <p>•	to provide information, content and offerings tailored to our customers' needs;</p>
    <p>•	for general research and statistical purposes; and</p>
    <p>•	for aggregated reporting purposes within the JMB group;</p>
    develop new products and services; and
    monitor the performance of our products and services and/or improve our technology.</p>
    <p><b>vii. Website Improvement:</b> Personal Information collected through our websites, such as via cookies or other tracking 
    technologies, will be used to allow us to assess browsing behaviours on our websites, to understand where improvements 
    can be made, to optimize our products and services and personalize and improve your experience on our websites and Apps.</p>
    <p><b>viii. Performance Analysis:</b> we will use your Personal Information (including by anonymizing and aggregating it with 
    other customers' Personal Information) for sales, supply chain and financial analysis purposes, to determine how JMB is

    <h5>3) HOW WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
    <p>We treat your Personal Information with care and confidentiality and do not share it with third parties other than as set out below:</p>
    <p><b>i. With other JMB’s website Group entities:</b> We will share limited Personal Information which you provide when you sign up (your name, email 
    address, password and your address) with other JMB Group entities to enable the global single sign-on and for authentication purposes, so 
    that you can use the same sign in information anywhere in the world and our systems will recognize your details.
    We may share information we keep in your profile with other JMB Group entities if both entities are responsible for your 
    Personal Information, or if the other entities are acting as our service providers and processing your Personal Information 
    on our instructions or on our behalf.</p>
    <p>We may share information we keep in your profile with JMB International Marketing BV if you choose to participate in an JMB 
    global campaign or competition. JMB International Marketing BV is the entity that acts as campaign promoter on global JMB campaigns.</p>
    <p>We will also share your other Personal Information, as well as anonymized and aggregated information, with other JMB Group entities 
    (such as JMB A.G., the parent company of the group, and/or other JMB entities as necessary). They will use this Personal Information for 
    trend analysis.</p>
    <p><b>ii. With Legal and Law Enforcement:</b> JMB will disclose Personal Information where required by law or legal process, for the 
    administration of justice, to protect your vital interests, for investigations by law enforcement or regulatory bodies, to protect 
    and defend JMB' property and legal rights, to protect the personal safety of JMB website or (mobile) app users or by order of a 
    valid injunction from a court or law enforcement agency.</p>
    <p><b>iii. In a Business Transaction:</b> We reserve the right to transfer any Personal Information we have in the event that we merge 
    with or are acquired by a third party or should a third party acquire all or part of our business or should any such transaction 
    be proposed.</p>
    <p><b>iv. With your consent:</b> We will share your Personal Information with other third parties (different from those described above, 
    for example, technology centres or when you decide to connect our devices with third party devices) in other limited circumstances. 
    In these instances, we will, where required by applicable law, obtain your consent to share your Personal Information in this way.</p>
    <p><b>vi. With Service Providers:</b> We share Personal Information with our cloud service providers for the purposes of identification 
    and authentication, so that you can log on to your JMB account quickly and with the ease and speed you expect from us from anywhere 
    in the world.</p>
    <p>We will also share your Personal Information as necessary and only for the purposes described in this privacy statement with 
    various third parties who process your Personal Information on our behalf, such as third parties that run our loyalty program and/or 
    hosting, delivery, payment and fraud management providers, credit scoring agencies and analytics platform providers. We require that 
    these service providers and other third parties adhere to strict rules when processing your Personal Information, including to only 
    use your Personal Information in accordance with JMB' instructions and the applicable laws.</p>
    <p>You can find a list of current JMB Data Recipients who process your personal data under JMB instructions attached. The list is 
    subject to change as necessary.</p>
    
    <h5>4) HOW WE PROTECT YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h5>
    
    <p>We are committed to protecting the Personal Information we control, and we implement technical and organizational security measures 
    to help protect it against any unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage. Personal 
    Information may be accessed by persons within our organization, or our third-party service providers, who require such access to 
    carry out the purposes described in this privacy statement, or such other purposes as may be permitted or required by the applicable 
    law. Personal Information we collect is maintained with the primary source of the information located on our servers in Germany.</p>
    <p><b>i. We will keep your Personal Information for two years from your last interaction with us,</b> such as the date your account was 
    deleted, your last purchase, the last time you used one of our Apps or in some other way contacted or interacted with us, unless 
    a longer or shorter retention period is required by law, is necessary in the course of legal proceedings or is otherwise needed for 
    a particular purpose under applicable law.</p>
    <p>The following are examples to illustrate how JMB keeps your Personal Information for as long as necessary for a particular purpose:</p>
    <p>•	we may keep your Personal Information collected during a purchase for as long as required by tax laws (longer than 2 years 
    in some countries); and</p>
    <p>•	we may keep your Personal Information for a shorter period if you ask us to delete your Personal Information. In such a case, 
    JMB will aim to delete your Personal Information within a maximum period of one month from the date of the request, and subject to 
    legal restrictions.</p>
    <p><b>ii. We may store and process your Personal Information in Canada and other foreign countries that provide hosting or other services 
    to us.</b> For example, the Personal Information you provide when you sign up for an JMB account will be stored in Canada and also by other 
    JMB group entities and our cloud services providers located outside Canada for the purposes of authenticating your account and signing 
    you in. In these circumstances we will take appropriate steps to ensure that your Personal Information is protected. Typically, such 
    steps include carrying out data security reviews of any recipients and putting in place contracts with such recipients to ensure they 
    employ the same or similar appropriate technical and organizational measures as JMB, so your data remains protected. However, where 
    Personal Information is stored or processed outside of Canada (whether by the JMB group or a service provider), it is subject to the 
    laws of that foreign jurisdiction, and be accessible to that jurisdiction’s governments, courts, or law enforcement or regulatory agencies.
    As a general rule,<b> we do not intentionally collect Personal Information about children under the age of 13</b>. If we become aware that we 
    have inadvertently collected Personal Information about children under the age of 13, we will take steps to delete the information as 
    soon as possible, except where we are required by applicable law to keep it.
    If a child under the age of 13 attempts to sign up for an JMB account, he or she is initially asked to provide the information as described 
    above. In addition, the data submitted by and collected about the child during the course of his or her visit (e.g. via cookies) may be 
    used as described in this Statement. However, if a child under the age of 13 attempts to complete the sign up, this will be rejected 
    with the notification that accounts for child under the age of 13 cannot be created. For that reason, we ask parents and guardians to 
    check on and monitor their children’s Internet usage in order to protect them.
    <p><b>iii. Our Websites may contain links to Third-Party Websites,</b> and some of our services provide you with access to third party 
    services (such as social networks).
    We have no control over how third-party websites and services process your Personal Information. We do not review third party websites 
    and services, and we are not responsible for such third-party websites and services or their privacy practices. Please read the privacy 
    statements of any third-party websites or services that you access from our websites or services.

    <h2 style='text-align: center;'>COOKIE STATEMENT</h2>
    <p style='text-align: right;'>LAST UPDATED: March 19, 2020.</p>
    
    <h3>WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT COOKIES</h3>
    
    <h4>FIRST OF ALL…WHAT ARE COOKIES?</h4>
    Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. For this section, we conveniently 
    use 'cookies' as an umbrella term for techniques such as cookies, Flash cookies and web beacons. They don’t take much space and they will 
    be removed automatically when expired. Some cookies expire at the end of your internet session, while others will be saved for a limited 
    amount of time.
    
    <h4>SECONDLY…WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT COOKIE TYPES WE USE?</h4>
    
    
    <p>There are different types of cookies with different uses. Some exist just to allow you to browse the website and see certain features. 
    Some give us an idea of your browsing experience (i.e. if you have trouble finding what you are looking for), so that we can improve our 
    website’s functionality and make your future visit as pleasant as possible.</p>
    <p>Cookies set by JMB are called <b>'first party cookies'</b>. Cookies set by parties other than us are called 'third party cookies'. Third party 
    cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through JMB’ website (e.g. advertising, interactive content 
    and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer or mobile device, (i) when it visits the website 
    in question and (ii) when it visits certain other websites.
    Another important distinction is <b>“required cookies”</b> vs. <b>“functionality cookies”</b> vs. <b>“advertising and social media cookies”</b>. Required 
    cookies are essential to running a website and help you to navigate on the website and use its basic features, including media plugins. 
    Then there are functionality cookies, which enable you to save your shopping bag, create a wish list and to save your shipping details 
    for a quicker checkout. These performance and analytics cookies collect information about how visitors use our website and used to improve 
    our website. We also like to show you relevant offers. To manage this we collect browsing data, which may be linked to a unique identifier 
    to allow us to understand how you interact with JMB across different platforms as described in our privacy statement (click here for our 
    privacy statement). Advertising and social media cookies capture your preferences in order to show you relevant ads outside of JMB sites. 
    These interaction cookies are used for you to interact with social media or to submit reviews and may be used to track your activity over

    <h4>NEXT…WHY DO WE USE COOKIES?</h4>
    <p>JMB uses cookies primarily to ensure your visit to our website is as pleasant as possible, as well as for advertising-related purposes 
    during your future visits to other websites. Below is a more detailed overview of the types of cookies we are using and why:</p> 
    <p><b>25.	Required Cookies</b>: are essential and help you navigate, move around on the website and see certain features (e.g. these cookies 
    make sure your basket is saved during all the steps of your checkout process). These cookies are required to enable core site functionality. 
    These cookies are stored for the duration of your browsing session.</p> 
    <p><b>26.	Functionality and Analytics Cookies:</b> are included so that we can give you an even smoother customer experience (i.e. these cookies 
    help you to save and remind you about your shopping bag and enable you to create a wish list). These cookies allow us to analyze site 
    usage so we can measure and improve performance. These cookies may be placed by us or a third party on our behalf (see the “opt out” 
    options provided below) and are stored for the duration of your browsing session.</p> 
    <p>The web analytic services on our website and mobile applications are provided by our agent, Adobe Site Catalyst (www.adobe.com). 
    This means that when you visit our website or mobile applications, a cookie by Adobe Site Catalyst will be stored on your computer or 
    mobile device, except when your browser settings don’t allow for such cookies. This further means that when you visit our website or 
    mobile application, various web analytics data (e.g. click-stream data, data from web beacons and tracking links and information stored in 
    Adobe Site Catalyst cookies) will be sent to Adobe Site Catalyst for analysis for and on behalf of JMB. Please note that if you have 
    created an online profile at our website or mobile application and if you are logged on in this profile, a unique number identifying 
    this profile is also being sent to Adobe Site Catalyst in order to be able to match the web analytics data to this profile. You can 
    find out more about the relationships between JMB and Adobe Site Catalyst in the Adobe’s privacy policy under “Adobe Hosted Services” 
    at http://www.adobe.com/privacy/policy.html. Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc., also acts as an agent 
    to JMB. Google Analytics uses Cookies to help the website analyze how users use the site.</p> 
    <p><b>27.	Advertising and Social Media Cookies:</b> There are a variety of advertising and social media cookies used, including:</p> 
    <p>- Targeting Cookies: will remember your product and buying preferences or assist marketing efforts in other ways. These cookies 
    enable us to share data, such as what you like, with our service providers and third-party websites, so the advertisements you see 
    can be more relevant to your preferences.</p> 
    <p>- Performance Cookies: These help us understand visitors’ shopping behaviours. This enables us to keep improving our website, 
    so shopping becomes easier and more pleasant, and to improve the marketing messages we send to our customers.
    <p>- Interaction Cookies: are used for you to express your opinion. These cookies will enable you to like or recommend us on social 
    media and to chat with our service agents. You can also advise our other (potential) customers by rating and reviewing our products.</p> 
    <p>Our website and mobile applications use re-targeting technologies that enable us to show our visitors, who were already interested 
    in our shop and our products, advertisements from us on third party websites.</p> 
    <p>We also work with other companies who use tracking technologies to serve ads on our behalf across the Internet. These companies 
    may collect information about your visits to our websites and/or mobile applications and your interaction with our communications, 
    including advertising. Currently, we use the following technologies to deliver these services to us, including Google Display 
    Network (GDN), Facebook, Salesforce Marketing Cloud, Adobe Ad Cloud; and Media Math. Below we have provided information on how to opt
